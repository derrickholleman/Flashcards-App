# About Thinkful-Flashcards
Thinkful Frontend Capstone Project - Flashcard-O-Matic
This application allows a user to create their very own deck of flashcards so that they can study effectively. 
A new deck can be created which will in turn allow for new cards to be created. 
Each card has a front side with a question and a back side that will provide the answer.
